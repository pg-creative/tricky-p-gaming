# CLAUDE.md - SEEKER Project

> Session handoff document. Start here for project context.

## Project Status

**Brand**: SEEKER (finalized 2025-11-26)
**Phase**: Brand complete, ready for logo exploration + site rebuild
**Last Session**: Brand discovery interview, identity finalized

## The Brand: SEEKER

**Tagline direction**: "Video games as art. Seeking meaning in the interactive medium."

**Core concept**: A cosmic seeker who treats games as parallel realities worth understanding deeply. Not reviews - Journeys. Not surface content - meaning.

**Visual direction**:
- Cosmic observatory aesthetic (celestial, transcendent)
- Art museum reverence (games as masterworks)
- Deep cosmic blues, celestial gold, warm amber

**See**: `docs/BRAND-FINAL.md` for complete brand guide
