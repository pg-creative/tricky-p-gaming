## The Brand: SEEKER

**Tagline options:**
- "What can this world teach us?"
- "Always seeking meaning"
- "Where games become art"

**Brand story:**
> "I'm not a reviewer. I'm not a critic. I'm a Seeker - always searching for what games can teach us about life, art, and ourselves. Every game is a world. Every world has meaning. I find it."

## The Fusion

Seeker combines three elements:

| Element | Source | What It Brings |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **The Persona** | Seeker | Warm, curious, journey-focused, always searching |
| **The Space** | Aethon | Cosmic observatory, celestial, transcendent, ethereal |
| **The Reverence** | Opus | Games as art, museum-quality presentation, gallery feel |

**The result:** A cosmic seeker who moves through a celestial space, treating each game world as a masterwork of art worth understanding deeply.

## Website Vision

### Feel
Walking into a cosmic observatory crossed with an art gallery. Vast but intimate. Celestial but warm. Each game world is presented as a masterwork.

### Homepage
- Cosmic depth with breathing room
- Subtle particle effects, stars, celestial movement
- A central "Currently Seeking" or featured world
- Gallery-style presentation of pillar pages
- Warm gold accents guide the eye

### Navigation
- **Worlds** - Pillar pages (Kingdom Hearts, Soulslike, etc.)
- **Discoveries** - Your content, insights, analysis
- **The Journey** - About you, your story
- **Seeking** - What you're currently exploring

### Pillar Pages
Each pillar page is an **immersive world** with its own sub-aesthetic while maintaining the cosmic frame:
- Kingdom Hearts: Warmer, lighter, more magical
- Soulslike: Darker, ember-lit, challenging
- Baldur's Gate: Rich, textured, choice-driven feel
- etc.

The cosmic observatory is the HUB; each pillar is a DESTINATION.

## Origin Story (for About page)

The Seeker's journey began with Kingdom Hearts at age 5-6 - a revelation that games could be beautiful, emotional, meaningful. That childhood wonder evolved through Dark Souls Remastered in late teens - a crucible that taught mastery, perseverance, and the depths games could reach.

Now, with a background in philosophy, literature, creative writing, and music, the Seeker brings a unique lens to gaming: seeing patterns others miss, connecting games to life, treating every world as a universe worth understanding.

**Core philosophy:**
> "Games are parallel realities. Who's to say they're not real? This is an opportunity to explore other worlds, other universes, and to learn more about yourself and life."

### Review Rebrand Options

Instead of "Reviews" - Seeker-aligned alternatives:
- **Findings** - "What the Seeker found"
- **Discoveries** - "A discovery in [Game]"
- **Journeys** - "Journey into [Game]"
- **Illuminations** - "Shedding light"
- **Reflections** - "Reflecting on [Game]"

### The Web Structure

Pillar pages link to essays, which embed videos, which link to tier lists, which connect to shorter articles. Everything webs together - a universe within the brand.
